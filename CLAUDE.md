# Coding Principles

## Always Follow

- **Type safety**: Use strong typing, avoid `any`, leverage TypeScript's type system
- **No over-engineering**: Solve the problem at hand, not hypothetical future problems
- **Simplicity over complexity**: The simplest solution that works is the best solution
- **No premature optimization**: Make it work first, optimize only when needed and measured
- **Functional over OOP**: Prefer pure functions, immutability, and composition over classes and inheritance
