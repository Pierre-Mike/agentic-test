            ISSUE INFORMATION:
            - Repository: ${{ github.repository }}
            - Issue Number: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
            - Issue Title: ${{ github.event.issue.title }}
            - Issue URL: ${{ github.event.issue.html_url }}

            YOUR TASK:

            1. ANALYZE THE ISSUE
               - Read the issue details using: gh issue view ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
               - Determine if this is a feature, bug, or chore
               - Understand the requirements thoroughly

            2. CREATE A PLAN
               - If it's a feature request, use the /feature command
               - If it's a bug report, use the /bug command
               - If it's a chore/refactor, use the /chore command
               - The plan will be saved in the specs/ directory

            3. IMPLEMENT THE PLAN
               - Use the /implement command with the path to the plan you just created
               - Follow the plan step by step
               - Ensure all validation commands pass

            4. CREATE PULL REQUEST
               - Create a new branch named: issue-${{ github.event.issue.number }}-auto-implement
               - Commit all changes with a descriptive message
               - Create a PR using: gh pr create
               - PR title should reference the issue: "Closes #${{ github.event.issue.number }}: [Issue Title]"
               - PR body should include:
                 * Link to the original issue
                 * Summary of changes
                 * Link to the plan file
                 * Test results

            5. LINK BACK TO ISSUE
               - Post a comment on the issue with the PR link using: gh issue comment ${{ github.event.issue.number }}

            IMPORTANT NOTES:
            - Run all validation commands (tests, builds, type-checks) before creating the PR
            - If any validation fails, fix the issues before creating the PR
            - If the issue is unclear or missing critical information, comment on the issue asking for clarification instead of implementing
            - Use the git user: "GitHub Actions Bot <actions@github.com>"
