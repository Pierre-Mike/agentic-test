            ## YOUR TASK

            ### Step 1: Gather Context
            1. Run `gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` to get PR details
            2. Run `gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` to see all changes
            3. If PR is linked to an issue, read the issue for requirements context

            ### Step 2: Review the Code

            Evaluate the changes against these criteria:

            **Correctness:**
            - Does the code do what it's supposed to do?
            - Are there any logic errors or bugs?
            - Are edge cases handled?

            **Code Quality:**
            - Is the code readable and maintainable?
            - Does it follow existing patterns in the codebase?
            - Are there any code smells or anti-patterns?

            **Security:**
            - Are there any security vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, etc.)?
            - Is sensitive data handled properly?
            - Are there any hardcoded secrets?

            **Testing:**
            - Are there appropriate tests for the changes?
            - Do the tests cover edge cases?

            **Performance:**
            - Are there any obvious performance issues?
            - Any N+1 queries, unnecessary loops, etc.?

            ### Step 3: Leave Inline Comments

            For specific issues, leave inline comments on the exact lines:
            ```bash
            gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/pulls/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/comments \
              -f body="[Your comment]" \
              -f path="[file path]" \
              -f line=[line number] \
              -f side="RIGHT"
            ```

            ### Step 4: Submit Review

            Based on your review, submit ONE of these:

            **APPROVE** - If the code is good and ready to merge:
            ```bash
            gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --approve --body "## ✅ Approved

            [Brief summary of what the PR does well]

            **Review Summary:**
            - Correctness: ✅
            - Code Quality: ✅
            - Security: ✅
            - Testing: ✅

            LGTM! Ready to merge."
            ```

            **REQUEST_CHANGES** - If there are issues that must be fixed:
            ```bash
            gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --request-changes --body "## 🔄 Changes Requested

            [Summary of issues found]

            **Issues to Address:**
            1. [Issue 1]
            2. [Issue 2]

            Please fix these issues and push an update."
            ```

            **COMMENT** - If you have suggestions but no blocking issues:
            ```bash
            gh pr review ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --comment --body "## 💬 Review Comments

            [Summary of the PR]

            **Suggestions (non-blocking):**
            - [Suggestion 1]
            - [Suggestion 2]

            Overall looks good, consider the suggestions above."
            ```

            ## REVIEW GUIDELINES

            1. Be constructive and specific - explain WHY something is an issue
            2. Differentiate between blocking issues and suggestions
            3. Acknowledge good patterns and improvements
            4. For auto-implemented PRs, verify the implementation matches the issue requirements
            5. Don't nitpick style issues if they follow existing patterns
            6. Focus on correctness, security, and maintainability
